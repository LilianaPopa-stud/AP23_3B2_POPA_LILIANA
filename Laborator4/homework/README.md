Homework (2p)

- [x] Create a class that describes the problem.
- [x] Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the students that have a number of preferences lower than
  the average number of preferences.
- [x] Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for students and projects.
- [x] Create a Greedy algorithm in order to solve the problem.

Bonus (2p)

- [x] Implement an algorithm that determines the maximum cardinality matching ... or you may use the following libraries
  in order to solve it:
  JGraphT Graph4J
- [x] Create a random problem generator (with thousands of objects) and test the performance of the implementation (try
  both libraries). Compare the results with the ones obtained by the greedy algorithm.
- [ ] Determine a minimum cardinality set formed of students and projects with the property that each admissible pair (
  student-project) contains at least an element of this set.
- [ ] Determine a maximum cardinality set of of students and projects such that there is no admissible pair (
  student-project) formed with elements of this set. Resources
